    "description": "Throughout his career Delacroix was inspired by the novels of Sir Walter Scott, a favorite author of the French Romantics. This painting depicts a scene from Ivanhoe: the Jewish heroine Rebecca, who had been confined in the castle of Front de Boeuf (seen in flames), is carried off by two enslaved Muslim warriors commanded by the covetous Christian knight Bois-Guilbert. The contorted, interlocking poses and compacted space, which shifts abruptly from the elevated foreground to the fortress behind, create a sense of intense drama. Apart from the still life at the lower left, the only element of calm is Rebecca herself."

    "description": "In this commissioned portrait, as Marcel Proust observed, Renoir gave expression to 'the poetry of an elegant home and the beautiful dresses of our time.' In the Japanese-style sitting room of her Parisian townhouse—the décor and chic gown testifying to her stylish taste—Marguerite Charpentier sits beside her son, Paul. At age three, his locks are still uncut and, in keeping with current fashion, he is dressed identically to his sister Georgette, perched on the family dog. The well-connected publisher's wife, who hosted elite literary salons attended by such writers as Flaubert, the Goncourts, and Zola, used her influence to ensure that the painting enjoyed a choice spot at the Salon of 1879."

    "description": "A landmark of European portraiture that asserts a modern, scientifically minded couple in fashionable but simple dress, this painting was nonetheless excluded from the Salon of 1789 for fears it would further ignite revolutionary zeal. Technical analysis has revealed that a first iteration excluded the scientific instruments and would have been a far more conventional portrait of a wealthy, fashionable couple of the tax-collector class. Lavoisier was a pioneering chemist credited with the discovery of oxygen and the chemical composition of water through experiments in which his wife actively collaborated. However, he was also involved in studies of gunpowder and a misunderstanding about his removal of this precious commodity from the Bastille in the summer of 1789 threw his alliances into question. This mishap and his status as a tax collector (the more prosaic means by which he funded his scientific research) led him to be guillotined in 1794."

    "description": "Cypresses gained ground in Van Gogh’s work by late June 1889 when he resolved to devote one of his first series in Saint-Rémy to the towering trees. Distinctive for their rich impasto, his exuberant on-the-spot studies include the Met’s close-up vertical view of cypresses (49.30) and this majestic horizontal composition, which he illustrated in reed-pen drawings sent to his brother on July 2. Van Gogh regarded the present work as one of his “best” summer landscapes and was prompted that September to make two studio renditions: one on the same scale (National Gallery, London) and the other a smaller replica, intended as a gift for his mother and sister (private collection)."

    "description": "Clara Peeters was a founding figure in the history of European still life, a genre that attracted many women artists who did not have the opportunity to study nude models. In this ambitious composition, Peeters paid close attention to naturalistic details like dewdrops, insect bites, and drooping tulips that hint at transience and decay. At the same time, she asserted her own achievement by inscribing her signature in the stone ledge, juxtaposed with a fallen sprig of forget-me-nots. The crisp edges and acute observation that characterize her work reveal the close link between floral painting and botanical illustration during the Scientific Revolution."

    "description": "In the lower, terrestrial portion of this composition, the shepherd kneels in an Alpine landscape, while in the upper, celestial portion, a vision unfolds of eight nude women. In contrast to the shepherd’s muscular, naturalistically depicted body, their pale, ethereal forms indicate that they are apparitions. The women may symbolize enlightenment, harmony with nature, and erotic desire. Their frieze-like arrangement and stylized, rhythmic gestures recall the work of Puvis de Chavannes, which Hodler greatly admired. This ambitious composition, first exhibited in Geneva in 1896, was one of the paintings that earned the Swiss artist notoriety for his exploration of sexuality, mortality, and the unconscious."

Inspired by Venetian portraits of the High Renaissance, Van Dyck depicted Van Uffel as a learned gentleman, with signs of his varied interests: dividers, a recorder, the bow of a viola da gamba, an antique head, a drawing, and a celestial globe. Van Uffel’s unusual posture, as though turning to address the beholder, lends dynamism to his portrait."

The masterly depiction of the stable, which is viewed from slightly below, and the columnar solidity of the figures are typical of Giotto, the founder of European painting. The impetuous action of the kneeling king, who picks up the Christ Child, and Mary’s expression of concern translate the biblical account into deeply human terms. As the sculptor Ghiberti declared (ca. 1450): '[Giotto] made [art] natural and gave it gentleness.'"

It celebrates the civilizing and nurturing effects of love, as milk flows from Venus’s breast and Mars’s warhorse is restrained. Possibly commissioned by Emperor Maximilian II, the painting was owned by Emperor Rudolf II in Prague by 1621, along with other mythological works by the artist. A masterpiece of light and color, works such as this had an enduring impact on later artists including Velázquez and Giambattista Tiepolo."

Here, Venus tries to stop her lover from departing for the hunt, fearing—correctly—that he would be killed. The mood of sensuality, conveyed by the beautiful depiction of Venus, seen from the back, enhances the viewer’s sense of the tragic end to this story, expressed through their exchanged glances and the frightened Cupid. Titian’s workshop made multiple versions of this composition, but this one is of exceptional quality and was painted by Titian himself."

Like his contemporary Poussin, Claude viewed landscape through a classical lens: he represents the women of Troy setting fire to their ships in an effort to end years of wandering after their city was seized by the Greeks. Distant clouds and rain presage the storm sent by Jupiter at Aeneas’s request to quench the blaze. The subject must have particularly appealed to the man who commissioned it. Cardinal Girolamo Farnese was a prelate who returned to Rome in 1643, after years of itinerant service as papal nuncio combating Calvinism in remote Alpine cantons of the Swiss Confederation."

    "description": "This painting belongs to a celebrated group of Fragonards known as the fantasy figures. The canvas is broadly brushed, with exceptional virtuosity, panache, and a sense of speed. The model has recently been identified as the aristocratic salon hostess Marie Emilie Coignet de Courson (1716–1806). Her costume recalls the court dress of Queen Marie de Médicis (1573–1642) in Rubens’s famous series of paintings (Musée du Louvre, Paris) which Fragonard had occasion to study in 1767. There is humor in the contrast between the ample proportions of the lady and the small size of her lapdog; the curl of his silky tail echoes her gray ringlets."

Details such as the piercing of Christ's side with a spear, the breaking of the legs of the thieves, and the Virgin swooning into the arms of her companions ensure an emotional response from the viewer. A century later, Van Eyck, in his painting in The Met, added to these pictorial strategies the extraordinary naturalism of a landscape setting replacing the gold ground of Italian painting and introducing a sense that the Crucifixion took place within the context of contemporary life."

A cloth of honor has been pulled aside to reveal a distant landscape, where we witness the transition from dormant to verdant nature—a metaphor, like the dawn sky, for death and rebirth. The asymmetrical composition looks ahead to the work of Titian. When Albrecht Dürer visited Venice, he declared Bellini the best painter. The fine Venetian frame is of the period."

It was painted during the tumultuous times of the Iconoclasm (1566), which disrupted the art market and motivated a change from purely religious to more secular themes. Here the flourishing fish industry is celebrated through the display of the great bounty from the sea. Such pictures also increasingly embraced a moralizing subtext, warning against the excesses of food and sexual pleasures."
